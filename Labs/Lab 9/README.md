We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

<!-- Answer Down Here -->
1st step is preperation.
when you have a client they may have different needs, they may already have a server that they want you to deploy your site on, they may have nothing and they may need to move the server. In our case our client has nothing so we would have to start from scratch. This would require purchasing a domain name and purchase web hosting. Personally when it comes to website developement I think it's easier(and cheaper) to create a live site with wix, squarespace, and wordpress. These sites allow you to have more freedom with your component placements and make it easier to visualize the full picture. They do lack functionality and are more for personal use then they would be for website games or other buisness websites. For those it may make sense to use goDaddy to get a domain because those seemed reasnobly cheap.
2nd step is to get DNS access, this creates a dev admin access site which can allow you to modify DNS records and give you full control over the functionality.
3rd step is to create a live testing site. This is set up in the same location as the full site will be but with the 'dev' preface in the title. You do this to test the functionality of the website before submiting it for public use.
4th is to set up email accounts
this will allow the site to collect email addresses and ping mail servers. You have to be careful not to lose the email records or have them hacked because a lot of places 
5th is to backup and go live
take a fullbackup unless something is lost or corrupted, then you cross your fingers and hope for the best.
dont forget to write your keywords in white text all over the page so google can find you. ;P
